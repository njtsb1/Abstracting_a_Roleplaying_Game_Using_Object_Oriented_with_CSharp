# Abstracting a Role-playing Game Using Object Orientation with C#
I reinforced my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C# with a totally hands-on design challenge. For this, the pillars of object orientation were explored in the context of an RPG game. With that, I developed my ability to abstract with a real problem and implemented the evolutions that I deemed necessary.
